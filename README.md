# Data Engineering Toolkit
The Data Engineering Toolkit provides lightweight Python scripts for common data engineering tasks:

- Cleaning raw data
- Transforming data frames
- Loading data into files

## Project Goal:
This toolkit aims to learn version control with Git as taught in the Data Engineering Community Launchpad program.
Iâ€™ll be creating scripts that clean data, load data, and transform data, as well as pushing changes to GitHub to practice collaborative workflows.
